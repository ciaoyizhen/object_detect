# Object Detect

You can track the latest updates by visiting the project's github addressï¼š[Object Detect Repository](https://github.com/ciaoyizhen/object_detect)

Requirement:

```
python >= 3.10
```

## update
```
2024.9.1: support data enhancement
2024.9.2: support visual annotation file in web demo
2024.9.3: support nms in demo
2024.9.9: fix polygon
```

## Goal
Use huggingface to implement a variety of tasks, and you can replace the model at any time without modifying the code.

## Train Step:
```
1. python -m venv .env
2. source .env/bin/activate
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. modify yaml config
5. torchrun main.py (yaml_path) or python main.py
```

## Eval Step:
```
python demo/inference_demo.py
```

## WebUI
```
1. python demo/web_demo.py
2. open link with your browser
```

> Note: during training, only the model file is saved, for the image pre-processing, it is not saved, you need to manually put the pre-processing configuration file into the model file to be used

## FAQ
1. open too many file
```
ulimit -n xxx  # increase open file
```
2. How to download a model to train
```
1. open this (https://huggingface.co/models)
2. choose and download a model
3. modify yaml
```
3. Multi Gpu how to train
```
torchrun --nproc-per-node=x main.py configs/test.yaml

see more in (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/elastic/run.html)
```
4. About offline, like `models--timm--resnet50.a1_in1k`
```
1. you download model
2. put this model to your ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/

note: if you want deploy this model, maybe you need add this model in docker root/.cache
```
